Expirmenting with a Facebook bridge concept to link students/staff from Facebook more seamlessly into the tracker application.

* Automatic creation of events/groups on facebook based on admin actions in tracker.

* Seamless "estimations" of turn out to events based on Facebook "Attending" responses to events.

* Posting messages from tracker admin to facebook groups/events.  (Using Facebook as an alternate medium for communication, perhaps - users can configure this to receive only certain kinds of messages via certain mediums)
